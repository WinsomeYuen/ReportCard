# ReportCard
An app that allows a school to store a student’s grades

## Why this project?
Custom classes are critical to every object-oriented program you will build going forward. It is vital to be able to think about how to design objects which interact with each other and model real-world concepts.

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Designing a custom class
- Creating that class in Java code.
- Storing information in an array
- Looping through an array
